# flattest_lowest_hillclimbing solving by Dynamic Programming

Rule:
Everytime walk from one point to another and count:
   If going horizon or vertical only have to cost the energy: 

   start point's hieght plus absolute value of two point's height differential

   If going diagonal direction, then have to cost the energy: 

   start point's hieght plus 1.4 muptily absolute value of two point's height differential

And find the lowest cost path
