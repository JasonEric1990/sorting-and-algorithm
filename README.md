What I learned from the book , class or otherplace and add some additional rules or function to the origin problem

<b>1. Building Heap.c (iteration & recursion)</b>


<b> 2.maximum subarrray: Using Divide and Conquer to solve Maximum subarray problem</b>

*with the rule that only one negative integar can be put in the subarray


<b> 3.flattest_lowest_hillclimbing: Using Dynamic Progamming to solve Hill climbing problem</b>

*find the lowest cost path

<b> 4.sudoku: Using Backtracking(DFS) to solve Sudoku problem</b>

*the data is read by a line of string, 0 means empty

<b> 5.n-queen: Using Backtracking(DFS) to solve n-queen problem</b>
