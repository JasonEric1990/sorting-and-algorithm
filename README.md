# Algorithms
What I learned from the book , class or otherplace and try to change it to make it better

<b>1. Building Heap of bottom up (iteration & recursion)</b>

ps:
A little tricky of for loop.In c you have to notice the value of index to prevent making contradiction with condition.

<b> 2.maximum_subarrray.c: Using Divide and Conquer to solve Maximum subarray problem</b>

*with the rule that only one negative integar can be put in the subarray


<b> 3.flattest_lowest_hillclimbing: Using Dynamic progamming to solve Hill climbing problem</b>

*with lowest cost path
