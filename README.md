What I learned from the book , class or otherplace and add some additional rules or function to the origin problems




<b> 1.maximum subarrray: Using Divide and Conquer to solve Maximum subarray problem</b>

*with the rule that only one negative integar can be put in the subarray


<b> 2.flattest_lowest_hillclimbing: Using Dynamic Progamming to solve Hill climbing problem</b>

*find the lowest cost path

<b> 3.sudoku: Using Backtracking(DFS) to solve Sudoku problem</b>

*the data is read by a line of string, 0 means empty

<b> 4.n-queen: Using Backtracking(DFS) to solve n-queen problem</b>

*the first queen's position is randomly decided

<b> 5.generic two way merge: use same code to do the computation
