# Maximum subarrray problem solved by Divide and Conquer


<b>There is an additional rule:</b>

The maximum subarray can only have one negative integar

EX:

Given 2 3 4 -1 -2 11 -7

The normal solution 2 3 4 -1 -2 11 is illegal, so the answer is 11

<b>Data input:</b>

The first input is the number of elements in the array(array's size)

So solving the problem 2 3 4 -1 -2 11 -7, typing the array of numbers below:

7
2 3 4 -1 -2 11 -7

<b>Output:</b>

summation and maximum subarrray
