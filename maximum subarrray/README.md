# Maximum subarrray problem solving by Divide and Conquer


There is an additional rule:

The maximum subarray can only have one negative integar

EX:

Given 2 3 4 -1 -2 11 -7

The normal solution 2 3 4 -1 -2 11 is illegal, so the answer is 11

And the first input is the number of elements in the array(array's size)

So if you want to solve the problem 2 3 4 -1 -2 11 -7, you should type:

7
2 3 4 -1 -2 11 -7
